# Cashflow Calendar 🛠️📊

My first public project.

Cashflow Calendar is a scrappy finance tracker I’m building to see what’s coming before it happens — bills, income, and projected balance over time.

Think: less spreadsheet juggling, more clear day-by-day cash flow visibility.

## Status 🚧

Very early build.  
Still shaping core features, moving fast, and refactoring as I go.

Expect:
- rough edges
- changing structure
- frequent updates

## What it does right now ✅

- tracks upcoming transactions
- projects daily balance forward
- gives a simple view of short-term cash flow

## Why I’m building it 💡

I wanted a tool that feels practical and lightweight for real life — something I can actually use, tweak, and improve without overcomplicating it.

## Stack 🧰

- ASP.NET / Blazor
- PostgreSQL
- Docker Compose

## Next up 🔭

- smarter forecasting logic
- cleaner dashboard + UX polish
- better transaction workflows
- auth/user improvements

## Feedback 🤝

If you’ve got ideas, suggestions, or spot bugs, open an issue — I’m building this in public and learning as I go.
